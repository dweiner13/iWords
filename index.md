## iWords

iWords is a small GUI wrapper around the excellent WORDS program by William Whitaker, maintained now at [https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/](https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/). The intention is to be a worthy followup to the venerable but obsolete [Interpres program](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza/).

This project is in early stages and is not releasesd yet. Downloads and more information coming soon.
