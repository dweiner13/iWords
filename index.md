## iWords

iWords is a macOS Latin dictionary and parsing app that leverages the excellent 
[WORDS program](https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/) by William Whitaker. The hope is to continue the legacy of the 
venerable [Interpres app](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza/), which
is 32-bit and unsupported on modern macOS.

This project is in early stages and is not released yet. Downloads and more information coming soon.
