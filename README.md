# iwords
This is a project to build a replacement for the venerable but now obsolete [Interpres program](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza). The intention is to be a nice macOS GUI wrapper around the WORDS program, written by William Whitaker and maintained now [here](https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/).

This project is still in alpha. See [the project website](https://danielweiner.org/iwords) for additional details.

## Pretty mode
To enable the debug "pretty" mode, attempts to parse Words output into a structured output that can be formatted in a GUI, launch iWords with the command-line argument `-resultDisplayMode 1`. Note that this is highly WIP.
