# iWords
### See project website at [iWords.org ↗](https://iwords.org)

A replacement for the now-discontinued [Interpres app](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza). The intention is to be a nice macOS GUI wrapper around the WORDS program, written by William Whitaker and maintained now [here](https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/).

> [!NOTE]
> iWords is no longer under active development. It works fine, and bug fixes will continue, but no new features or enhancements will be done. If you're interested in taking over iWords development, please reach out to me. See [iWords.org](https://iwords.org) for contact details.**

This project was still in alpha when it went into maintenance mode — as such, some of the codebase may be messy.
