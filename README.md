# iwords
This is a project to build a replacement for the venerable but now obsolete [Interpres program](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza). The intention is to be a nice macOS GUI wrapper around the WORDS program, written by William Whitaker and maintained now [here](https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/).

This project is still in beta. Releases have no auto-update mechanism and may be broken.
