# iwords
A replacement for the now-discontinued [Interpres app](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza). The intention is to be a nice macOS GUI wrapper around the WORDS program, written by William Whitaker and maintained now [here](https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/).

This project is still in alpha, so some areas of the code are in a prototype state (i.e., messy).

See [the project website](https://danielweiner.org/iwords) for additional details.

## Contributions
Since the project is still in alpha, it's not accepting contributions at this time (if you have feedback or are interested in working on iWords, please get in touch with me).

## Pretty mode
To enable the debug "pretty" mode, which attempts to parse Words output into a structured output that can be formatted in a GUI, launch iWords with the command-line argument `-resultDisplayMode 1`. Note that this is highly WIP.
