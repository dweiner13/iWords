# iwords
A replacement for the now-discontinued [Interpres app](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza). The intention is to be a nice macOS GUI wrapper around the WORDS program, written by William Whitaker and maintained now [here](https://mk270.github.io/whitakers-words/).

**⚠️ NOTE: iWords is no longer under active development. It works fine, and bug fixes will continue, but no new features or enhancements will be done. If you're interested in taking over iWords development, please reach out to me.**

This project is still in alpha, so some areas of the code are in a prototype state (i.e., messy).

See [the project website](https://iwords.org) for additional details.
